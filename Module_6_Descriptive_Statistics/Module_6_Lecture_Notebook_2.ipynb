It proves that we can learn some important characteristics of a population of values by examining the corresponding values from a *random sample* of the population. (Recall that for a sample to be random each member of the population must have an equal probability of being chosen for the sample.) For example, if we want to estimate the average level of presidential support in the US population we would take a random sample of the US population (typically 1-3000 people) and then compute the mean (and standard deviation) of presidential support for the sample. \n",

The Central Limit Theorem states that, virtually regardless of the distribution of the quantity of interest in the population, the distribution of sample *means* of the quantity of interest will resemble a Normal distribution for a sufficiently large sample size. Since the properties of a Normal distribution are known (as we saw above) we can make inferences about population values. \n",
